This project leverages large language models (LLMs) to create musical compositions following counterpoint rules, then validates them against classical music theory principles.

## Features
- Generate musical counterpoint melodies using various AI models (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Google Gemini)
- Convert between MIDI and LilyPond formats for musical notation
- Analyze melodies for adherence to counterpoint rules
- Provide feedback on musical characteristics including:
  - Note variety
  - Apex point placement
  - Melodic structure
- Robust error handling for API interactions
- Export results as MIDI, LilyPond (.ly), and PDF files
